This is a simple C# implementation of an expression evaluator using the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

## Usage üöÄ

1. Include the `RPN.cs` file in your project.
2. Call the `RPN.Evaluate()` method with an infix expression as input to obtain the result.

Example:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string infixExpression = "2 + 3 * (4 - 1)";
        double result = RPN.Evaluate(infixExpression);
        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
    }
}
```

## Testing üß™

- The algorithm wasn't submitted to intense testing, but it did pass a basic test put together by ChatGPT.
